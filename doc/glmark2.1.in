.SH NAME
@appname@ \- OpenGL (ES) 2.0 benchmark suite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @appname@ [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@appname@\fP is a benchmark for OpenGL (ES) 2.0. It only uses the subset of
the OpenGL 2.0 API that is compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-benchmark\fR BENCH
A benchmark to run: 'scene(:opt1=val1)*'
(the option can be used multiple times)
.TP
\fB\-\-validate\fR
Run a quick output validation test instead of
running the benchmarks
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-swap\-buffers\fR
Don't update the screen by swapping the front and
back buffer, use glFinish() instead
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-scenes\fR
Display information about the available scenes
and their options
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Display debug messages
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help
.SH BENCHMARKS
@appname@ offers a suite of scenes that can be used to measure many aspects
of OpenGL (ES) 2.0 performance. The way in which each scene is rendered is
configurable through a set of options. To get the available scenes and their
acceptable options you can use the \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-scenes\fR command
line option.

In @appname@, a benchmark is defined as a scene plus a set of option values.
You can specify the list and order of the benchmarks to run by using the
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-benchmark\fR command line option (possibly multiple times).
If no benchmarks are specified, a default set of benchmarks is used. If a
benchmark option is not specified it assumes its default value (listed with
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-scenes\fR).

As a special case, a benchmark description string is allowed to not contain a
scene name (i.e. to start with ':'). In this case, any specified option values
are used as the default values for benchmarks following this description
string.

.SH EXAMPLES
To run the default benchmarks:
.PP
.RS
\fB@appname@\fR
.RE
.PP
To run a benchmark using scene 'shading' with a 'duration' of '5.0' seconds and
 'shading' of type 'phong':
.PP
.RS
\fB@appname@ -b shading:duration=5.0:shading=phong\fR
.RE
.PP
To run a series of benchmarks use the \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-benchmark\fR command
line option multiple times:
.PP
.RS
\fB@appname@ -b shading:duration=5.0 -b build:use-vbo=false -b texture\fR
.RE
.PP
To set default option values for benchmarks:
.PP
.RS
\fB@appname@ -b :duration=2.0 -b shading -b build -b :duration=5.0 -b texture\fR
.RE
.PP
