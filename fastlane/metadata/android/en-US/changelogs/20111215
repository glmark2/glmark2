==========================

* Add benchmark for bilinear filtering implemented in the fragment
  shader (not included in the default benchmarks).
* Ensure we don't call any GL functions before binding a GL context.
* Fix bug in the ShaderSource object that could lead to shader
  compilation errors in strict OpenGL ES 2.0 implementations.
* Refactor scene update code to reduce duplication.
